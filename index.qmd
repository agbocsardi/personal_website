I’m Gergő. I’m from Hungary and I’m currently doing my PhD at [JADS](https://jads.nl) in the Netherlands.

Here you will mostly find my thoughts about things I find interesting, be it personal or professional. I like to think the spice of life is following my curiosity, so if you find the topics chaotic, you have been warned.

Find out more about [my research here](research.qmd)!
